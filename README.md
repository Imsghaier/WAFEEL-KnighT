This project  provides an in-depth exploration of web application vulnerabilities, focusing particularly on SQL injection, a major cybersecurity threat. The project starts with an analysis of common security flaws like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection. Based on this research, a custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) called WAFEEL-KniGhT is developed to defend against these attacks.

The report covers the selection of appropriate tools, technologies, and techniques to create a robust defense against malicious web traffic. It then details the practical implementation of the WAF, including coding, testing, and refining the solution. The aim is to offer a hands-on understanding of web vulnerabilities and create a security solution to protect applications from evolving threats.

Ultimately, this project  highlights the design, testing, and continuous efforts required to secure web applications in todayâ€™s dynamic digital environment.
